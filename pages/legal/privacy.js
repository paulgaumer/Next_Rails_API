      It is Podwii's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we
      may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to{' '}
      <a href="https://podwii.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://podwii.com
      </a>{' '}
      (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://podwii.com"). We respect your
      privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable
      information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this
      privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be
      collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what
      circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This
      Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website
      and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our
      Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of
      our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website, you
      may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
    <p>
      Like most website operators, Podwii collects non-personally-identifying
      information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
      available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
      and the date and time of each visitor request. Podwii's purpose in
      collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand
      how Podwii's visitors use its website. From time to time, Podwii may
      release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
      publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Podwii also collects potentially personally-identifying information like
      Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving
      comments on https://podwii.com blog posts. Podwii only discloses logged in
      user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses
      and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
    </p>
    <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>
      Certain visitors to Podwii's websites choose to interact with Podwii in
      ways that require Podwii to gather personally-identifying information. The
      amount and type of information that Podwii gathers depends on the nature
      of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at
      https://podwii.com to provide a username and email address.
    </p>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
      that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its
      absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Advertisements</h2>
    <p>
      Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
      partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to
      recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to
      compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
      information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
      advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
      Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Podwii and does not cover the
      use of cookies by any advertisers.

      terms and conditions of every site you visit.

      privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or
      services.

    <h2>Https://podwii.com uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
    <p>
      Https://podwii.com uses the remarketing services to advertise on third
      party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It
      could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a
      task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an enquiry.
      This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results
      page, or a site in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors,
      including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits.
      Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own
      privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google
      Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of interest-based
      advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser
      plugin.
